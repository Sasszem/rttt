# Rust tic-tac-toe

This is my first ever Rust project. Wrote it after I read the Rust book.

This is a very simple command-line tic-tac-toe game. Features:
- "fancy" ASCII art graphics
- AI that plays against you
- multiple difficulty levels based on different strategies

Code should be appropriately commented and documented. This runs on a single thread, so most memory-safety features are kind-of unused. They also did NOT really get in my way though at all, which was a bit unexpected...
